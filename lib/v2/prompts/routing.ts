CRITERIA
"""
CODE
Writes code to call Acme CRM's API by calling FUNCTIONS
It CAN'T search by name - in this case, use DIRECT instead
Use when:
- performing calculations, aggregating & slicing data and plotting outputs returned from FUNCTIONS (examples: "Plot the top 5 products by profitability in the past 6 months" or "Which warehouse has the highest total value of stock?")
- performing batch edits/adds (example: "Make all the summer products inactive" when there's a update_product function)

DIRECT
Calls FUNCTIONS 1-by-1. Can run CODE as a subroutine, but it is slower
Use when:
- searching by name (example: "How much is the Alpine Redwoods property worth?")
- retrieving or editing <5 datapoints (example: "Update XYZ product's price to $20")
- retrieving already aggregated data from FUNCTIONS (example: "What's the total value of stock in the warehouse?")
${
  args.org.chat_to_docs_enabled
    ? `
DOCS
Searches Acme CRM's documentation
Use when:
- asked how-to questions
- asked questions about how the system works
- asked what terminology means

RULES:
1. Select from CODE${

      } or DIRECT following the CRITERIA and output after "Choice:"
2. Follow the format below - include Thoughts (as a numbered list) and Choice:
"""
Thoughts:
1. Think step-by-step how to answer the user's request
2. ${
        args.org.chat_to_docs_enabled

          : "break down the user's request into steps"
      }
3. specifically name EVERY SINGLE function and variable you will use
4. consider if the user's request requires searching by name - use DIRECT if so
5. compare the user's request with CRITERIA
6. state your choice
